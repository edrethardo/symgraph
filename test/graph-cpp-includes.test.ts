/**
 * C++ #include capture and include-closure disambiguation (edge-coverage
 * step 2).
 *
 * Quoted includes become `imports` edges: resolved same-dir first, then by
 * unique path-suffix match (headers are found through -I roots, so the
 * literal path is a suffix of the repo path); system includes (<...>) are
 * skipped. The include closure then breaks bare-call ties the repo-global
 * uniqueness gate must refuse: a name defined twice in the repo resolves iff
 * exactly one definition is visible from the calling file — through the
 * closure itself, or through the .h ↔ .cpp stem convention (a definition in
 * solver.cpp is visible where solver.h is included, since prototypes are not
 * indexed as nodes). Ambiguity within the closure still drops.
